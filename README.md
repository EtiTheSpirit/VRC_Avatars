# VRC_Avatars
My VRChat avatars that are public

# How to use
I am uploading entire save files to the Releases subsection (Click [here](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/VRC_Avatars/releases) to see releases)

Open these save files in unity. All of the assets should automatically be imported properly.
